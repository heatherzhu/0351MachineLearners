Oh, Bob. You could never threaten me.   I'm firing you because you're lazy, entitled and incompetent. I'm firing you because you don't work hard. So if you know what's good for you, you'll shut up, take off that ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get drunk. Because if you say one more word, Richard here is going to call security and have you thrown out on your ass. Are we perfectly clear? Bob nods.
